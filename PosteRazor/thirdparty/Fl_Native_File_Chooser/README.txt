** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE **

The api is not finished, but simple browsing and filename preloading
is usable.

** Only OSX and Windows currently supported. **

To be done:

	o Polish up the API
	o Support unix by using fltk's own chooser
	o Finish implementing filename filters for OSX and Windows
	o Fix all the XXX's and TBD's (egrep 'XXX|TBD' *)
