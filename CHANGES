PosteRazor 1.1
==============
-   Fixed: Step 1, information fields are not updated when changing
           the unit while still no Image is loaded.
-   Fixed: Dropping of images on the PosteRazor caused a crash
           on OSX
-   Fixed: Fixed a small memory leak that occurred when the help
           dialog was opened more than once
-   Added: The poster preview is (optionally) rendered using OpenGL
           PosteRazor can still be compiled and used without OpenGL
-   Added: PosteRazor has a Settings dialog for setting Dimension
           units, Language and Usage of OpenGL
-   Added: An input image can be specified by command line (or drag
           and drop on the program icon). It is loaded at startup.
           Unfortunately, this still doesn't work on OSX.
