PosteRazor can be compiled with FreeImage which is not included in
the PosteRazor source tree. The headers and libraries libraries
need either to be installed on the system or in this folder.
The project files on Windows look into this folder for them.

You can get FreeImage from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/
either by download or CVS.

FreeImage needs to be installed into a folder "FreeImage" below
this folder. PosteRazor requires the "Dist" subfolder with the
headers and built static libraries in it. The project files of
PosteRazor have relative paths that expect those folders to be
here.

For Visual Studio .Net:
Open the solution "FreeImage\FreeImage.sln", set the
"Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library" of the
"FreeImageLib" project to "Multi-threaded DLL" in the release
configuration. Do the same for the projects "LibJPEG", "LibMNG",
"LibPNG", "LibTIFF" and "ZLib". Then compile the "FreeImageLib"
project in release configuration. The result is a ca. 7mb big
"FreeImage\Dist\FreeImage.lib".
