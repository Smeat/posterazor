-   Fixed: PosteRazors image preview tries not to crash if an image

PosteRazor 1.3
==============
This version was skipped. A few web sites offered version 1.2
labelled as 1.3. This was probably just a mistake which is
fixed by skipping this version.

           This translation is included only in the Win32 version
-   Added: French translation by Martin Loyer
-   Added: +/- Spin buttons for poster size in pages
- Changed: Numbers in input fields are selected instead of changed
           on mouse drags. Should be more standard conformant.
           Display precision of numbers is 4 pos. after dec. point

==============
-   Fixed: Step 1, information fields are not updated when changing
           the unit while still no Image is loaded.

           on OSX
