PosteRazor needs FLTK and FreeImage which are not included in
the PosteRazor source tree. The headers and libraries libraries
need either to be installed on the system or in this folder.
The Project files for Visual Studio .NET look into this folder
for them.

FLTK ("fltk-1.1")
=================
You can get it from http://www.fltk.org either by download or SVN.
PosteRazor was developed with FLTK 1.1.7. But any following 1.1.x
FLTK should do it, since the backwards compatibility is usually
kept.

Fltk 1.1.7+ needs to be be installed into a folder "fltk-1.1"
below this folder. PosteRazor requires the "FL" subfolder with
the headers and the "lib" subfolder with the built static
libraries in it. The project files of PosteRazor have relative
paths that expect those folders to be here.

For Visual Studio .Net 2003:
Open the solution "fltk-1.1\vcnet\fltk.sln and" compile the
project "fltk" in Release configuration. The resulting binary is
"lib\fltk.lib".

FreeImage
=========
You can get it from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/ either by
download or CVS.

FreeImage needs to be installed into a folder "FreeImage" below
this folder. PosteRazor requires the "Dist" subfolder with the
headers and built static libraries in it. The project files of
PosteRazor have relative paths that expect those folders to be
here.

For Visual Studio .Net 2003:
Open the solution "FreeImage\FreeImage.sln", set the
"Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library" of the
"FreeImageLib" project to "Multi-threaded DLL" in the release
configuration. Do the same for the projects "LibJPEG", "LibMNG",
"LibPNG", "LibTIFF" and "ZLib". Then compile the "FreeImageLib"
project in release configuration. The result is a ca. 7mb big
"FreeImage\Dist\FreeImage.lib".
