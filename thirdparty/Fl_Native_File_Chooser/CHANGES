0.81 -- 11/28/2005 linux version cleanup
----------------------------------------
        o Support documented filters
	o free/strdup -> new/delete
	o added #ifndef at top of FL/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.H to prevent recursion

0.80 -- 11/27/2005 erco+nate: code merge, cleanup
-------------------------------------------------
	o Merge in Nathan's changes
	o Updated docs for all changes noted here
	o Rewrote mac's filter code to support old "*.a" and new "Desc1\t*.a\nDesc2\t*.b" syntax
	o Changed Nathan's set_filter() -> filter_value() (consistent with FLTK's own chooser)
	o Renamed test program to test-browser.cxx
	o Code cleanup: variable + method naming, 80 column conformance, indents, strdup/malloc -> new
	TODO: Linux version needs code cleanup (strdup -> new, etc)

0.70 -- 08/04/05 erco: general cleanup
--------------------------------------

	o Implemented Linux.
	  This was easy -- just use Fl_File_Chooser.

	o Removed references to non-existant size() method from docs;
	  the correct method name is total_filenames()

0.62 -- 02/02/2005
------------------

	o Added Ian's mods to main.cxx to use getcwd() instead of fixed path

	o Added #include/#define's to support getcwd() under Windows VS

0.61 -- 01/26/2005
------------------
	o Applied Ian MacArthur's 01/26/2005 fixes,
	  and Makefile.fltkconfig, including tab fixes and line 90 .obj -> .o fix.

	o Enabled /Wall on Windows VS7.x, and fixed all problems related to Fl_Native*
	  (mainly, ctor type value was being ignored)
