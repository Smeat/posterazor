Here goes the FLTK 1.1 source tree. You can get it from
http://www.fltk.org either by download or SVN.

PosteRazor requires the "FL" subfolder with the headers and the
"lib" subfolder with the built static libraries in it.

Please make sure that at least those two folders reside in the
same folder as this file you are reading. The project files
of PosteRazor have relative paths that expect those folders to
be here.

For Visual Studio .Net 2003:
Open the solution vcnet\fltk.sln and compile the project "fltk"
in Release configuration. The resulting binary is "lib\fltk.lib".
